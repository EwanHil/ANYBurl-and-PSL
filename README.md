# ANYBurl-and-PSL
Part of my MSc project to utilise ANYBurl rules in PSL

## Pre-processing
The preprocessing.py file can be used to generate the datasets required for ANYBurl to generate the rules

## Using PSL to evaluate ANYBurl rules
main.py allows rules generated  by ANYBurl to be passed to PSL
