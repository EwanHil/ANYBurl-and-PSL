# ANYBurl-and-PSL
Part of my MSc project to utilise ANYBurl rules in PSL

## Pre-processing
The pre_main() function in the main.ipynb notebook can be used to generate the datasets required for ANYBurl to generate the rules

## Using PSL to evaluate ANYBurl rules
The main() function in the main.ipynb notebook allows rules generated by ANYBurl to be passed to PSL
