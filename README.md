# ANYBurl-with-PSL 
Part of my MSc project to utilise AnyBURL rules in PSL. Finalised version available as of 09/11/2022

The run.sh file generates rules with AnyBURL and then infers predicates using PSL that are then evaluated to calculate H@K.

Zip file contains a README.md file that contains instructions of what to change in order to run AnyBURL with PSL
